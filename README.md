# ELEC-E8125 Reinforcement Learning - Final Project

## Part 1
Implementation of Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for continuous control tasks in the  InvertedPendulumBulletEnv-v0 and HalfCheetahBulletEnv-v0 environments.

## Part 2
Implementation of TD3 with behavioral cloning (TD3+BC) for offline reinforcement learning.
